This algorithm finds a set of global best matches for two sequences.

That is, given A[0...N], and B[0...M]

it finds a set of solutions which consist of

  -- The elements of A, possibly interspersed with gaps (denoted by '-')
  -- The elements of B, possibly interspersed with gaps (denoted by '*')
  -- An alignment of A with gaps over B with gaps, such that for at least 
     one i and j, A(i) is aligned with some B(j).

  An example:

  Sequence A:  CGAGGAA
  Sequence B:  ACGTGA

One solution may look like

A:     CGAGGAA
       || | |
B:    ACGTG*A

So there is a single gap in Sequence B while Sequence A is shifted by
one position with respect to Sequence B.

Another might be

A:     AC-GTCA
       |  |  |
B:   CGA*GG*AA

(this actually has more gaps and less matching alignments, so is not
likely to rank as high as the first solution, using any kind of
reasonable metric, and therefore would not be a 'best match').

(Note that it is possible to have a gap of more than a single space,
and more than one gap per sequence, although the former is not illustrated
above)

(Note that there may be a large number of reasonable solutions,
especially as the sequences get longer.)
 
What constitutes a solution depends on how one defines what
constitutes a 'good' match.

There are three parameters generally employed to determine a good match:

   -- How much to reward element alignment
   -- How much to penalize for the existence of a gap
   -- How much to penalize as a gap gets longer

It is possible to specify different rewards for different matching
alignments (e.g., a match of T on top with T on bottom could be given
a higher value than matching G on top with G on bottom).  It is also
possible to reward aligments that don't 'match': e.g., having T on top
and T on the bottom could generate a very high score, while T on top
and A on the bottom a somewhat lesser score, and T on top and either C
or G on the bottom a poor score.  So TT > TA > TC = TG.

It is theoretically possible to specify different penalties for gaps
and gap lengths in the first sequence vs in the second sequence,
although this code does not provide that functionality.

Determining the reward for element alignment is done by constructing a
SUBSTITUTION MATRIX, and, in this code, the corresponding SUBSTITUTION
FUNCTION, SUBF.  For any two sequence elements X and Y, (SUBF X Y) is
used to obtain the reward for X and Y being aligned.  See below for
more details.

Determining the penalties for a gap is done by providing a
GAP-PENALTY-FUNCTION or providing parameters that allow construction
of a function which increases linearly with increasing gap length.

Typical gap functions are one of:

  -- no gap penalty, i.e, #'(lambda (gaplength) 0.0)
  -- constant gap penalty, e.g., #'(lambda (gaplength) -1.0)
  -- gap penalty proportional to gap length, e.g.,
     #'(lambda (gaplength) (* 0.5 gaplength))
  -- one penalty for opening a gap and another linear term for
     extending it, e.g.,
     #'(lambda (gaplength) (+ 1.0 (* 0.25 (1- gaplength))))

The latter form is typically referred to in the literature as the affine
gap penalty function, and is commonly used.

The algorithm to figure the set of best alignments consists of three parts:

   -- Generate and fill an NxM SCORE matrix, where M is the length of Sequence 
   A and N the length of Sequence B.  The matrix values are determined by the
   order of the sequence elements and the reward and penalty parameters.

   -- Generate and fill an NxM BACKPOINTER matrix.  Each element (I,J)
   of the BACKPOINTER matrix determines an optimal alignment for the
   subsequences A[0...I] and B[0...J].

   -- Use the generated matrices to then figure out a set of best alignments.

The first two steps are usually done concurrently, and are done that way
in this code.

Let us from now on denote our sequences as SEQA and SEQB.
Let length(SEQA) = N, and length(SEQB) = M.

Assume that SEQA = CGAGGAA, SEQB = ACGTGA

Then the SCORE matrix initially looks conceptually like this, once it's
elements have been initialized to zero.

                 SEQB -->

          A   C   G   T   G   A      

      C  0.0 0.0 0.0
   
      G  0.0 0.0 0.0
 S
 E    A  0.0 0.0 0.0 . . .
 Q
 A    G           .
                  .
 |    G           .
 |
\ /   A
 .
      A

Given an index (i,j) into this matrix, we can compute what are called
the RESIDUES, (the symbols above the column and the symbols to the
left of the row) for the (i,j)th element of the SCORE matrix (which
are just the sequence elements of the two sequences at positions I and
J, respectively).  So the RESIDUES for position (3,5) are G and A,
while the RESIDUES for (0,0) are C and A.

Note that in all the code and all the examples, the matrix is indexed
using (i = ROW, j = COLUMN).  Further, I is always the first index and
J the second index.  (In the code SEQA is called 'SEQ-DOWN-ROWS' and
SEQB is named 'SEQ-ACROSS-COLS', for clarity)

 The substitution matrix, SUB, for our sequences might look like this:

    A   C   G   T
 
 A  1   0   0   0

 C  0   1   0   0

 G  0   0   1   0

 T  0   0   0   1

In this metric, all matches are rewarded equally, and all non-matches
are neutral (neither rewarded nor penalized).

Now to the details of the algorithm.

For any (i,j), SEQA[i] and SEQB[j] give us the RESIDUES (as above) for
position (i,j).  Given the residues, we can (conceptually) index into
SUB to determine the score for alignment of the two sequences at
position (i,j).  (Of course to index into an actual matrix one needs
numerical indices, so we really need the mapping A -> 0, C -> 1, G ->
2, T -> 3, given our example SUB matrix.  This mapping is provided
transparently by the function CREATE-SUBSTITUTION-FUNCTION-AND-MATRIX,
which returns a function which is called with the two residues.)

The algorithm uses the SUBSTITUTION FUNCTION to determine a value when
dealing with position (I,J).  First it gets the RESIDUES for I and J,
and then the SUBSTITUTION FUNCTION is called to get the score for
aligning the two residues.

The algorithm must first fill in values for all of the elements of SCORE
according to the following recursion relationship:

 For any given element SCORE(i,j), assuming we have already filled in
 all elements SCORE(k<i,l<j), the value of SCORE(i,j) will be

 A.  The MAXIMUM of three values

   1.  SCORE(i-1,j-1)

   2.  The maximum over k, of SCORE(k,j-1) + W((i-1)-k), k = 0...i-2
       (That is, a maximum over the elements in column J-1, down to 
       and including row I-2).

   3.  The maximum over k, of SCORE(i-1,k) + W((j-1)-k), k = 0...j-2
       (That is, a maximum over the elements in row I-1, over to 
       and including column J-2).

 B.  PLUS the value of SUB(SEQB[i],SEQA[j])

So what is W?  W is our penalty function for gaps and W(x) is the
penalty value for having a gap of length x.  The value of k determines
how big the gap is.  (Starting from the left edge, and going across,
as in 3, the size of the gap is a maximum at the left edge (k=0) and
decreases as k increases, and correspondingly as we move down a column
in 2.)

Given that we are careful to special-case the leftmost column and
uppermost row (since there is no J-1 column or I-1 row in these cases)
this algorithm can then be used to sequentially fill in the rest of
the array.

The BACKPOINTER matrix is filled in by determining which of the cases
from above, 1, 2, or 3, had the maximum score, and setting the backpointer
to point from cell (I,J) back to the cell which held the maximum score.

So for the cell labelled '*' in the below matrix, the recursion formula
looks at all cells labelled '+'

- - - + - -
- - - + - -
+ + + + - -
- - - - * -
- - - - - -

For these cells, we find the cell that has the maximum value according
to the recursion formula, and set the backpointer to point to that
cell.  (The code handles the case where two or more cells hold maximal
values).

The SCORE matrix (*SCOREMAT*), and the BACKPOINTER matrix
(*POINTERMAT*) are computed by the GENERATE-NEEDLEMAN-WUNSCH-SCORES
function below.

Note: the recursion relationship described above is one of two such
global alignment recursion formulas found in the biology literature.
For a discussion of the differences, and an implementation of the
other one, see the files match-essay.txt and global-alignment.lisp in
this directory.

Note: why the algorithm works is beyond the scope of this explanation.
See, for example, Gusfield, "Algorithms on Strings, Trees and
Sequences", Chapter 11.)

What do the numbers in the SCORE matrix mean once we compute them?
Basically, the numbers tend to increase as we go down and right, and
the more positive an element (I,J) is, the better it is to align the
two sequences such that SEQA[I] is over SEQB[J].

To determine a best alignment, now all we need to do is follow the
backpointers we have set up.  What we do is start from a position with
the highest score in the bottom row or rightmost column, and work our
way up and to the left (towards the origin) via our backpointers,
creating paths through the matrix from this point back to the origin.
The geometry of these paths determine the alignment.  (Since there may
be more than one such maximal point along the bottom row or rightmost
column, and there may be more than one backpointer from a given cell,
there may be numerous best alignments).

Given a path through the matrix, how do we determine what sequence
alignment it specifies? 

This is how: For any given (I,J) in our path, the sequence lines up
at that point and therefore the RESIDUES at (I,J) constitute the
alignment at that point.

Given point (I,J) in the path, if the previous point in the path is at
(I-1,J-1), this means there is no gap.

Otherwise, there is a gap.  If the previous point is above (I-1,J-1),
then the gap is in the sequence which got indexed across the columns,
while if the previous point is to the left of (I-1,J-1), then the gap
is in the sequence which got indexed down the rows.

So suppose we have the following path back through the matrix:

(5,5) -> (3,4) -> (2,3) -> (1,2) -> (0,0), 

or graphically:

   A  C  G  A  C  T

A  *
G        *
A           *
A              *
A
T                 *


We start at the bottom right, at (5,5), with T aligned with T as the last 
characters of both sequences.  The next point is not at (4,4), but rather
at (3,4) which is above (4,4), so there is a gap in the sequence which got 
indexed across the columns (which means the element of the sequence indexed 
down the rows at position 4, A, is paired with the gap).  So we have
(remember, we are going backwards):
       
       AAT
       C*T

From (3,4) we go to (2,3), so there is no gap, and once more with no gap,
to (1,2), and we have:

     GAAAT
     GAC*T 

Finally, we go to (0,0) which is to the left of (0,1), so there is a gap
in the sequence indexed down the rows.  Our end result is therefore:

     A-GAAAT
     ACGAC*T

We can produce such alignments for every backpath as we choose.

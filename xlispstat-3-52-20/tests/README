This directory contains a set of tests adapted from the `thorough'
tests in new S.

To run the tests on a UNIX system, run xlisp (not xlispstat) from ..
and do

	(load "tests/test")

On a Macintosh, load the file test.lsp from the Tests folder.

You may accasionally see a failure in "math" or "prob" because random
data is used and I have not tuned things well enough yet to make these
failures rare.

To add new tests create a new file and add its name to the list defined
at the top of tests.lsp.

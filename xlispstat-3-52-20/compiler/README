This directory contains the lisp code for the XLISP byte code
compiler.  The "virtual machine" for running the code is mainly in the
file xlbcode.c in the C source directory.

This compiler is based on CPS conversion (see, for example, Friedman,
Wand and Haynes [2]). The design is based on the ORBIT compiler as
described in Kranz et al. [3] and on Brooks, Gabriel and Steele [1].

At this point the compiler does not do anything special for vectorized
arithmetic or anything else statistical. In the future I will explore
adding optimizations designed to deal with problems specific to
statistical usage. The basic design should make this reasonably easy.

Currently the compiler ignores all declarations and all proclamations
other than special ones. Future versions will use inline and optimize
declarations to choose among code generation strategies.

This is one weird box. The configure script required some major
hacking.  On the U of Mn's box running UMIPS 1.4.3 I used the
following, and set up configure to reproduce these settings. My
defaults were bsd43; if you use sysv defaults you may need to do set
CC to 'cc -systype bsd43'.

GRAPHSYS = X11WINDOWS
X11INCDIR_FLAG = -I/usr/RISCwindows4.0/include
X11LIBDIR_FLAG = -L/usr/RISCwindows4.0/lib

UCFLAGS = -O -Olimit 2000 -DMEMMOVE=memcpy -DNODIFFTIME
ULDFLAGS = -Wl,-D -Wl,c00000

EXTRALIBS =  -lmld
EXTRAOBJS =  isnan.o getcwd.o remove.o ctype.o

IEEE_FLAG = -DIEEEFP
ANSI_FLAG = -DANSI

FOREIGN_FLAG = -DFOREIGNCALL
FOREIGN_FILE = epix-foreign.h

CC = cc
LDCC = $(CC)

The configure script also digs the three files getcwd.o, remove.o,
ctype.o out of /lib/libc.a. I have no idea why i needed to do this
instead of putting -lc in as the last library to search, but doing
that causes crashes.

Finally, configure copies isnan.c from this directory to the main
source directory.

Dynamic loading seems to work, but requires compiling the code to be
loaded with -G.

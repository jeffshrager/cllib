To compile with cc on a snake with HPUX 9.0 I used

GRAPHSYS = X11WINDOWS
X11INCDIR_FLAG=
X11LIBDIR_FLAG=

UCFLAGS = -O -Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE
ULDFLAGS = -Wl,-E

EXTRALIBS=-ldld
EXTRAOBJS=

IEEE_FLAG=-DIEEEFP
ANSI_FLAG=-DANSI

FOREIGN_FLAG = -DFOREIGNCALL
FOREIGN_FILE = hpux-foreign.h

CC = cc
LDCC = $(CC)


Dynamic loading uses the shared library mechanism.  To load the
example function in foo.c, compile foo.c with the +z or +Z flags and
then create a shared object, say, libfoo.so with

	ld -o libfoo.so -b foo.o

Then load using (dyn-load "libfoo.so").

If you build the system with gcc, make sure you get the math library
that includes the `finite' function.

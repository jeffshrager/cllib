configure set things up for dynamic loading on

	uname -a => IRIX demo 5.2 04091117 IP22 mips

To compile with cc I used

GRAPHSYS = X11WINDOWS
X11INCDIR_FLAG=
X11LIBDIR_FLAG=

UCFLAGS = -O -Olimit 2000
ULDFLAGS =

EXTRALIBS=-ldl
EXTRAOBJS=

IEEE_FLAG=-DIEEEFP
ANSI_FLAG=-DANSI

FOREIGN_FLAG = -DFOREIGNCALL
FOREIGN_FILE = sysvr4-foreign.h

CC = cc
LDCC = $(CC)


Dynamic loading uses the shared library machanism. To load the example
foo.c, compile foo.c with

	cc -c foo.c

then do

	ld -o libfoo.so -shared foo.o

Then you can load with (dyn-load "libfoo.so"). You may have to make
sure the current directory is in your library search path for this to
work.

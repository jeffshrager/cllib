The following works on SunOS 4.1,

	uname -a => SunOS quetelet 4.1.3 3 sun4

I think it will work on 4.0 also, but if not, see the sunos3
directory. The configure script should set up a Makefile with these
settings (except for the X11 stuf, chich depends on your local setup).

GRAPHSYS = X11WINDOWS
X11INCDIR_FLAG=-I/usr/openwin/include
X11LIBDIR_FLAG=-L/usr/openwin/lib

UCFLAGS = -O -DMEMMOVE=memcpy
ULDFLAGS = 

EXTRALIBS=-ldl
EXTRAOBJS=

IEEE_FLAG=-DIEEEFP
ANSI_FLAG=

FOREIGN_FLAG = -DFOREIGNCALL
FOREIGN_FILE = sysvr4-foreign.h

CC = cc
LDCC = $(CC)

The -DMEMMOVE=memcpy is a hack since memmove does not seem to be
available. You do not need it on Solaris 2.0. If you compile with the
ANSI compiler acc (I think that is what it is usually called, unless
you have just replaces cc), use

ANSI_FLAG=-DANSI
CC=acc
	
You may also be able to drop the memmove define.

On sun3 hardware you may want to add an appropriate floating point
flag, such as -f68881, to UCFLAGS.


Dynamic loading uses the shared librayr system. To load the example in foo.c,
compile it with cc -c foo.c and then do

	ld -o libfoo.so foo.o

to create a shared library file. Then

	(dyn-load "libfoo.so")

should load it.


				 NOTE

Thee appears to be a bug in the standard c compiler's optimizer in
4.1.3.  I have added a workaround for one problem this bug causes, but
there may be others. It may be necessary on this OS version at least
to turn off optimization or to use gcc.

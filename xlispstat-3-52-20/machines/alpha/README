configure set things up properly on

	uname -a => OSF1 jupiter.stat.wisc.edu V1.3 111 alpha

To compile on an Alpha running OSF/1 I used

GRAPHSYS = X11WINDOWS
X11INCDIR_FLAG=
X11LIBDIR_FLAG=

UCFLAGS = -O -std -ieee_with_no_inexact -Olimit 2000
ULDFLAGS =

EXTRALIBS= -ldnet_stub
EXTRAOBJS=

IEEE_FLAG=-DIEEEFP
ANSI_FLAG=-DANSI

FOREIGN_FLAG = -DFOREIGNCALL
FOREIGN_FILE = sysvr4-foreign.h

CC = cc
LDCC = $(CC)


You can also use -ieee_with_inecact, but floating point performance
seems quite a bit slower. Using neither ieee option may give slightly
better performance, but you have to turn off IEEE_FLAG and don't get
proper ieee handling of infinities, etc..

To compile with gcc, I think you also need to turn IEEE_FLAG off,
unless there is some way to tell gcc to do th equivalent of
-ieee_with_no_inexact.

Dynamic loading is done using shared libraries. To make the example in
foo.c into a shared library, compile it with cc -c foo.c and then do

	ld -shared -o libfoo.so foo.o -lc

You can then use (dyn-load "libfoo.so"). You may need to use
"./libfoo.so" if the current directory isn't on your library search
path.

This is for systems without dynamic loading support. Use

FOREIGN_FLAG=
FOREIGN_FILE=dummy-foreign.h

For generic systems you should only need to decide whether to turn on
the ANSI and IEEE flags. If your system has an ansi C compiler, use

ANSI_FLAG = -DANSI

Otherwise use

ANSI_FLAG = 

If your system has IEEE 754 arithmetic and provides the functions
`finite' and `isnan' in its math library (or some other library),
use

IEEE_FLAG = -DIEEEFP

Otherwise use

IEEE_FLAG =

The configure script may be able to set this up for you.

If you want dynamic loading and have a system that is not directly
supported in the machines directory, check whether your system has
shared libraries and, if so, whether there is a programmer's interface
that let's you load a library and find a symbol's address in the
library. If so, it should not be too hard. Look at what is done for
hpux and for alpha, irix and solaris.

I no longer have access to a VAX, but I believe the following will
work under Ultrix or BSD, assuming X11 stuff is in a standard place:

GRAPHSYS = X11WINDOWS
X11INCDIR_FLAG=
X11LIBDIR_FLAG=

UCFLAGS = -O
ULDFLAGS =

EXTRALIBS=
EXTRAOBJS=

IEEE_FLAG=
ANSI_FLAG=

FOREIGN_FLAG = -DFOREIGNCALL
FOREIGN_FILE = bsd-foreign.h

CC = cc
LDCC = $(CC)

The configure script should set up the Makefile to use these options.

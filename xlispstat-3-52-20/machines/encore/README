It may be possible to make this code work with the current version of
xlispstat -- we no longer have one of these systems for me to test
things on.

This directory contains the foreign function calling include file for
an Encore Multimacs (or whatever it is called). This system does not
have ld -A but it does have its own dynloading routine. To compile with
this stuff 

	1) add -lld to the EXTRALIBS make variable
	2) add -Dhash=HXSH to the UCFLAGS variable

The second item is neeeded because the ld library contains a global
function called hash which conflicts with the global hash function in
xlisp.

You may also want to edit the foreign.h file to include your own libraries
to search in the loading process. At present there is no easy way to
specify a library from the Lisp level; I will add this sometime.

On a Scorpion running Solaris,

	uname -a => SunOS laplace 5.3 Generic_101318-41 sun4d sparc

I used the following. The configure shell script should set up a
Makefile with these settings (except possibly for the X11 stuff, which
depends on your local setup).

GRAPHSYS = X11WINDOWS
X11INCDIR_FLAG=-I/usr/openwin/include
X11LIBDIR_FLAG=-L/usr/openwin/lib

UCFLAGS = -O
ULDFLAGS =

EXTRALIBS=-ldl
EXTRAOBJS=

IEEE_FLAG=-DIEEEFP
ANSI_FLAG=

FOREIGN_FLAG = -DFOREIGNCALL
FOREIGN_FILE = sysvr4-foreign.h

CC = cc
LDCC = $(CC)

If you compile with the ANSI compiler cc, set CC to the appropriate
name and use

ANSI_FLAG=-DANSI

On sun3 hardware you may want to add an appropriate floating point
flag, such as -f68881, to UCFLAGS. Adding something like -fast
may also be useful.

Dynamic loading uses the shared library system. To load the example in
foo.c, compile it with cc -c foo.c and then do

	ld -G -o libfoo.so foo.o

to create a shared library file. Then

	(dyn-load "libfoo.so")

should load it. You may need to use "./libfoo.o" or make sure the
current directory is on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Anthony Rossinis suggest that to build with nonstandard X libraries
you can use something, such as X11R6.3 under Solaris 2.5.x, you can

	make EXTRALIBS='-ldl -lsocket' LDCC='LD_RUN_PATH=/apps/X11R6.3/lib gcc'

(assuming an initial configure --with-gcc --prefix=/blah/blah
command, else use cc instead for the LDCC command).

UNIX:

	Executing 

		configure
		make install

	should make the library and install it in the Autoload
	directory of the source tree.

	After configure, make echoserv echotest will make the little
	stand-alone tests.

Macintosh, CW Pro 2:

	Get the project file from 

		http://stat.umn.edu/~luke/xls/projects/sock/MacPPC

	and get CWGUSI from

		ftp://sunsite.cnlab-switch.ch/software/platform/macos/src/mw_c/

	I used version 1.8.1 but had to make two small changes for CW
	Pro 2 _ I think they were fairly obvious. Build, and manually
	install in the Autoload folder

Windows, Borland C++:

	Adjust the defines at the top of makefile.bc and

		make -f makefile.bc

	Then manually install in Autoload directory.
